## Project description

    TODO

Introduction to chosen topic in own words, possibly with a brief motivation

## Ideation

### Desk Research

Having selected "Cartoon" as our project topic, we first tried to find cartoon artists to give us some insight into their workflow and what they would like to see improved. Sadly, none of our posts on Reddit, nor E-Mails to cartoon networks, have been answered so far, so we relied on _existing conversations in creator lounges_, _existing applications in the field_, and on _blog posts_.

Before we entered the desk research, we already had some ideas of what we wanted to do, all revolving around a responsive cartoon-maker. But instead of following our initial ideas, desk research allowed us to see the abundance of flaws in the current workflow of cartoonists. It made us realize the scope of possibilities that we could pursue. Our sources indicate that webcomics are prone to die without innovation on both the creator and the consumer side. Artists often use general-purpose graphics software instead of specialized tools, and consumers seem to prefer more interactive content when consuming digital media.

### How-might-we's

With all of this in mind, we came up with our central questions:
How might we...

1. make it easier for beginners to learn drawing realistically?
2. help independent cartoonists grow their audience quickly?
3. reduce the idea-to-publication time in cartoon-drawing?
4. unify the overall workflow of cartoonists?
5. aid cartoonists in planning their story?

### Brainstorming

The 6-3-5 brainwriting technique was surprisingly effective at generating new ideas and expanding on our initial thoughts. The time limit and judgment-free environment resulted in a plethora of exciting ideas, many of which we would like to implement in our first prototypes.

We look forward to the prototyping phase, where we will explore different feature sets and interface elements.

## Evaluation

    TODO

## Low-fidelity Prototype

Our lo-fi prototyping happened in two stages: First, every member designed a very rough, 2D paper prototype showing their vision of one specific feature from our idea catalogue. After 30min, we had sketched

1. [a practice app with daily challenges](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/Other/dlofi01.mov),
2. [a layer-based, responsive panel editor](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/Other/dlofi02.mov),
3. [a side panel with references (from design inspiration over storyboards to character logs)](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/Other/dlofi03.mov),
4. [an interactive 3D reference model concept](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/Other/dlofi04.mov), and
5. [a library-esque navigation and unified export scheme](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/Other/dlofi05.mov).

Half a week later, equipped with materials for handicrafts, we met again to build more sophisticated user storyboards and prototypes. We looked into how we could

1. [intuitively switch between 3D reference model joint adjustments and drawing mode](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/IdeaA/),
2. [make navigating and exporting a breeze](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/IdeaB/Storyboard.pdf), and
3. [leverage the layering concept to create a 3D parallax sensation when a reader tilts their device](/Deliverables/LowFiPrototyping/IdeaC/).

Prototyping was simple and fun. We noticed that some concepts, for instance the parallax viewer, previously had no consensus when it came to their execution. Playing around with a paper model made things clear for everyone.

We enter the next stage with excitement and plan to focus on these three core features. How we weigh them will be determined in the mid-fi prototypes.
