_[M @margo#0239, T @thekwandry#2009, N @Narwhal#4175, and M @ThatFreakyWitch#8462 on July 29, 2022.](https://discord.com/channels/854144771357540352/854149028517642241/1002671776876216361)_

M: Question for those with page-format comics; what are the pixel dimensions of the pages you post? When I made comics years ago, my pages were only about 560 px wide, which seems miniscule these days

T: Mine are 800 px

M: Yeah that sounds reasonable
Tapas's max 940 px looks fine on Tapas, but it looks a bit silly on my own site

N: I go by inches instead of pixels. They are 6.75‚Äùx10.5‚Äù

T: Yeah I draw on a 8.5 x 11" canvas and then downsize for posting.

M: My working files are print resolution, so resizing isn't an issue
Just waffling about how exactly to resize haha

K: i work with 9 x 12

N: I based mine on standard comic printing, at least according to one website. Well I'll need to downsize my pages. According to the drawing program I use, my pages are 1013 x 1575 px

T: I usually like downsizing for internet posting anyway so thieves can't get away with high quality files.

N: I didn't even think about that. Nice. Fortunately I don't think it should shrink stuff too much, since the max width is 940

J: these are my thumbnails rn

It's like, there's 1000 rules about good things to do when framing, but when it gets down to it I just get lazy and put down like. 6 boxes

R: I tried doing a longform story in webtoon format, but it just didn't feel as good as traditional comic/manga panels

J: I don't think I could do webtoon format... I'm just a lot more used to reading manga so the conventions aren't as baked in to my brain

R: like, having the huge panel size difference in page by page is so crucial in things like drama and comedy I feel

F: its just preference tbh lol
i prefer reading webcomics over mangas tbh
cause the speech bubbles are set that you read from top to bottom and you don't get as confused compared to manga lol

R: webcomic is definitely less cognitive load to read
but good paneling is also a treat to see in manga

J: With the page by page like, it provides structure to fit your story into. Like 14-16 pages, and each page has to have its own lil tiny joke/cliffhanger or some kind of cohesion to it. So it's like that constraints helping with creativity thing

R: hard agree
i'm trying to adopt a 4page a week format that lots of twitter jp comics do

J: With webtoon I guess you also plan out how many panels you want each part of the story to take, but (from my perspective) you have u n l i m i t e d space
well, not horizontally I guess hhh

R: having limited pages makes you cut a lot of extraneous stuff

J: Yeah

F: you really do lol you can make a lot of cool transitions
which is why i ultimately decided to make webcomics

R: yup, it's important to make what you love the most
and not try to force a popular format

J: It's like, at one end you have something like houseki no kuni where every page feels like a separate, weighty illustration.
And then on the other end (of manga) you have these loose, free flowing panels where the emotions bleed into everything and it has a weightless feeling.
And then FURTHER on that end you have webtoon where everything is floating and free

but, I do wish it was easier to post these on tapas / webtoon or to have bigger sites for non-webtoon format. Cuz I have to shrink my pages a lot to post them üòõ
my saved page is at 5291x7488

F: i think it would depend on the artist too tho. like, the art on who made me a princess and solo leveling are crazy and can be seperate illustrations on their own

R: lol i also work at huge sizes, i think 4800 wide

F: your canvas shouldn't matter much, but your font sizes should

J: Here's the theory I just came up with, on one end you have like friezes / woodcuts, which is big page by big page. Then on the other end you have tapestries / scrolls, which is the webtoon format.
webtoon is a bit like the reinvention of the tapestry\
Yeah, the only thing that's a bit of an issue is the moir√© effect that I mentioned if you're using screentones + sizing down
Apart from that it's mainly okay, I don't draw my pages to be read on the phone but it still turns out okay

_Key takeaway: Paneling and formatting is time-consuming, often to a point where creators will just stick to something dull yet suboptimal or ditch certain platforms alltogether._
