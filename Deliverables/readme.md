Having selected Cartoon as our project topic, we first tried to find cartoon-artists to give us some insight into their workflow and what they would like to see improved. Sadly, none of our posts on Reddit, nor E-Mails to cartoon networks have been asswered so far, so we relied on existing conversations in creator lounges and on already existing applications in the field. 
Before we entered the desk research, we already had some ideas of what we wanted to do. But instead of following our initial ideas, desk research allowed us to see the abundance of flaws in the current workflow of cartoonists and made us realize the scope of possibilities that we could pursue. Collaborative working, platform integrations and innovative ways of exporting to multiple platforms were some of the topics that are currently not well done in existing platforms. Improving on these ideas could allow artists to improve their drawing skills more easily, help them grow an audience, unify their overall workflow and reduce their idea-to-publication time.
The 6-3-5 brainwriting technique was suprisingly effective at generating new ideas and expanding on our initial thoughts. The time limit and judgement-free environment resulted in many cool ideas that we would like to implement in our first prototypes. We look forward to the next stage of the prototype.
